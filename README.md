Things that I would like to update / things I would do differently:
- Do the Witting using Paragraph, Making it so it would automatically adjust if going off page
- More Graph and Charts
- Error Handling with the File/Json
- Make project more easily usable if someone else would want to use it 
Always open to suggestion and places to improve.
