Generates some statistics as a PDF from your downloaded Instagram and Snapchat Data, Used this as a project to gain experience with python and data handling.
Reinforced my understaning with JSON and Data Handling, Learnt alot about ReportLab and as the project continued.

Things that I will update soon:
- Have the Directories and the Path to the Data in a dedicated File to make more scalable (especially if Instagram or Snapchat change the way they share your JSON)
- Do the Witting using Paragraph, Making it so it would automatically adjust if going off page
- More Graph and Charts
- Error Handling with the File/Json
- Make project more easily usable if someone else would want to use it 
Always open to suggestion and places to improve.
